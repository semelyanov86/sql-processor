# SQL File Processor

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/yourusername/sql-processor)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/yourusername/sql-processor)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A robust Go-based service that monitors a directory for SQL files and executes them against a MySQL database. Notifications are sent via email for both successful executions and errors.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ **Real-time Monitoring**: Uses filesystem watcher for immediate detection of new SQL files
- ðŸ“§ **Email Notifications**: Configurable SMTP integration for success/error alerts
- ðŸ”’ **Secure Configuration**: All sensitive parameters stored in YAML config file
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Automatic file relocation and detailed error logging
- ðŸš€ **Lightweight**: Low memory footprint and efficient resource usage

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+ (compatible with 1.24)
- MySQL 5.7+
- SMTP server credentials

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-processor.git
cd sql-processor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go get github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify \
       gopkg.in/yaml.v3 \
       github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

3. Build the binary:
```bash
go build -o sql-processor
```

## Configuration

Create `config.yml` in the project root with following structure:

```yaml
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  user: db_user
  password: db_password
  name: database_name

smtp:
  server: smtp.yourprovider.com
  port: 587
  username: smtp_user
  password: smtp_password
  from: alerts@yourdomain.com
  to: admin@yourdomain.com

paths:
  input: ./sql/input
  output: ./sql/processed
  error: ./sql/errors
```

## Usage

```bash
./sql-processor
```

Directory structure will be automatically created if not exists:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ sql
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input      # Place new SQL files here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ processed  # Successfully executed files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ errors     # Files with execution errors
```

## Security Considerations

1. Keep `config.yml` with proper file permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 config.yml
```

2. Use environment variables for sensitive data (optional):
```go
// Modify in code to read from environment:
config.Database.Password = os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
```

3. Regularly rotate SMTP credentials

## Logging

All operations are logged to stdout with timestamps:
```
2024-03-12T14:35:22+03:00 INFO: Started watching directory ./sql/input
2024-03-12T14:35:45+03:00 INFO: Processing file: init_db.sql
2024-03-12T14:35:46+03:00 INFO: Successfully executed init_db.sql
```
